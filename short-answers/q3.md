# Question
Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer
The default behavior of the first button is to do nothing. The second button default behavior is to submit the information given to it. The third button will reset the form so no past data is inside of it and the last button will also do nothing since the type is button.
