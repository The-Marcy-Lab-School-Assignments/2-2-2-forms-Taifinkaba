# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer
It happened because of the "GET" method, which is when the data is appended to the URL. To fix this use the "POST" method so the user info isn't leaked from the URL. You can also use `.preventDefault` to stop the whole page from refreshing.
