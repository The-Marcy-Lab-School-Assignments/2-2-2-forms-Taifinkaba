# Question
Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer
You need labels for  every input for organization, and awareness. The label for text lets the user know what  they are writing the information for: first name, last  name,  username, etc. other labels indicate what the code  line is being used for on the designer end so they can connect them to other files like; CSS, JS, HTML. You can associate a input with the labels with a `id` or a `ARIA` label.

Yes you can use an ID to associate them if you add a "For" attribute to the label, so good job on that! However, theirs another way which is to nest the input inside of the label tags.
